## Contact List App

### App is hosted on Heroku at [https://safe-basin-70450.herokuapp.com/](https://safe-basin-70450.herokuapp.com/)

> This project implements an SPA using Angular 1.6 -> Architecture - went with a scalable, component based architecture which would be easier to upgrade to Angular2 (or Angular4)
> First and Lastname is required for new contact, email and phone display validations for improper input
> Deleting a contact actually marks them as inactive. Inactive contacts are filtered out of the list

#### Local Setup 

* `npm install`
* `gulp serve` - starts a local server 
* `npm test` - runs tests via Karma
